Manual Annotating or Assigning Polarity

25.2% of the Data Set is selected using simple random sampling for manual assignment of polarity. 20% is selected as the basis and the additional 5.2% will act as a buffer when the selected dataset is cleaned to preserve an estimated 20% base dataset for the training and testing dataset.

The idea of the additional 5% is due to the fact that an average of 25% is removed from the complete data set after cleaning. It is expected that similar scenario will play out after cleaning the selected training and testing data set.
